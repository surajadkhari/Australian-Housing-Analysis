🏘️ Australian Property Sales Dashboard – Excel Project
This repository showcases an interactive real estate analytics dashboard built entirely in Microsoft Excel. The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end data handling — from cleaning and transformation to insight generation and storytelling — using real-world property sales data.

🎯 Project Purpose
This project was developed to analyze key trends in the Australian housing market. It offers a visual breakdown of sales activity, pricing behavior, and agency performance using dynamic Excel tools.

Key Objectives:
Analyze the split between houses and units sold

Identify which suburbs have the highest sales volume

Highlight top-performing agencies by number of properties sold

Understand seasonal trends in property sales

Classify sales by price range

Explore the relationship between bedroom count and price

🌐 Data Source
Sourced via web scraping from CoreLogic Australia

Cleaned and transformed using Excel Power Query and formulas

The dataset includes:
Sale price

Number of bedrooms and bathrooms

Type of dwelling (House/Unit)

Sale date

Suburb and city

Real estate agency responsible for the sale

🧼 Data Preparation Workflow
All data wrangling was completed in Excel, following these steps:

Removed duplicates and cleaned null values

Handled inconsistent data (e.g., missing “Sold By” entries)

Standardized date formats for time-based analysis

Detected and excluded extreme outliers (e.g., properties listed at $1)

Converted price data into uniform numeric format

Applied basic statistical analysis to understand price trends
